# Number Guesser Game 🎲

This is a fun **Number Guesser Game** written in Python. The game selects a random number within a user-defined range, and the player has to guess the correct number!

## 🚀 Features
- User-defined range for the random number.
- Unlimited attempts to guess the correct number.
- Provides hints if the guess is too high or too low.
- Keeps track of the number of guesses taken.

## 📜 How It Works
The script generates a random number between `0` and a user-specified maximum value. The player then keeps guessing until they find the correct number, receiving hints along the way.
